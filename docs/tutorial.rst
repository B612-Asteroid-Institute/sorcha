Is an Object Detected by LSST?
-------------------------------
To check if an object is detected by LSST, we recommend using `Objects in Field <https://github.com/eggls6/objectsInField>`_. 
OIF requires a config file and a set of orbits. See our page on using objects in field for more information about 
the forms these can take.
