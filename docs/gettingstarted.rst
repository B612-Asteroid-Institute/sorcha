Getting Started
=====================

In this section we provide an overview of how to use the survey simulator. We start by generating a set of 
files containing information on the synethic planetoids that we wish to study. We take you through the process of generating
ephemerides for these synthetic bodiess using OIF (Objects in Field), and show you how to use surveySimPP. 

.. tip::
   In this quick start guide, we demonstrate how to run a single instance of OIF and surveySimPP. Both packages are designed to allow multiple instances to be run in parallel in order to accomodate simulations with very large numbers of synthetic planetesimals by breaking up the job across multiple live proccesses. We recommend first starting with the examples below, before moving on to parallel processing.


.. important::
  All the input files and configuration files used in this demonstation are available in the demo directory within the surveySimPP github repositor (survey_sim_pp/survey_simulator_post_processing/demo). Below includes instructions on how to generate these, but you can skip those setps and go straight to the run commands if you need to.

.. note::
  All input data files in this example are white-space separated format solely for the ease of reading.   

Move to the Correct Directory
---------------------------------
The command line arguments assume that the user is the downloaded surveySimPP directory::
   cd survey_sim_pp/survey_simulator_post_processing

Creating Object Files
-------------------------
The first step in the process is to generate a set of files which describe the orbital and physical parameters
of the objects that we wish to study. Here we will generate a file called 'testorb.des', which contains
the orbits of five objects::

   ObjID t_0 t_p argperi node i e q FORMAT

We will also generate a file called 'sspp_testset_colours.txt' which contains information about the colour and brightness of the objects::

OIF
-----------
The survey simulator post processing code relies on using an orbital calculator to generate ephemerides,
we recommend using Objects in Field, but you can use any orbital calculator as long as the outputs are 
consistent. Here we give an overview of how to use Objects in Field. If you are using another orbit calculator
then you can skip to the section on using the survey simulator.


Generate an OIF Config File 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The survey simulator post processing code comes with several command line utilities. One of these is 
a config file generator for Objects in Field. makeConfigOIF takes two required parameters, the name of 
the orbit file and the pointing database. There are several optional arguments which can be used to further 
customise your OIF usage. Details of these optional arguments can be seen in inputs.


The most basic OIF config file can be generated by typing::

   makeConfigOIF ./demo/sspp_testset_orbits.des ./demo/baseline_v2.0_1yr.db -no -1 -ndays -1 -camerafov instrument_circle.dat -spkstep 1

This will return the following::

   [CONF]
   cache dir = _cache/sspp_testset_orbits/1-10
   
   [ASTEROID]
   population model = ./demo/sspp_testset_orbits.des
   spk t0 = 60188
   ndays = 395
   object1 = 1
   nobjects = 10
   spk step = 1
   nbody = T
   input format = whitespace
   
   [SURVEY]
   survey database = ./demo/baseline_v2.0_1yr.db
   field1 = 1
   nfields = 216011
   mpcobscode file = obslist.dat
   telescope = I11
   surveydbquery = SELECT observationId,observationStartMJD,fieldRA,fieldDEC,rotSkyPos FROM observations order by observationStartMJD
   
   [CAMERA]
   threshold = 5
   camera = instrument_circle.dat

   output file = stdout
   output format = csv
 
This file will be saved as OIFconfig_test.ini in the directory it has been run within. 

Running OIF
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now that we have an OIF config file, we can easily run OIF by typing::

   oif -f ./demo/OIFconfig_test.ini > ./demo/test_oif_output.txt
  mv sspp_testset_orbits-01-10.ini OIFconfig_test.ini
   
The first few lines returned will look something like this::

   START HEADER
   [CONF]
   cache dir = _cache/sspp_testset_orbits/1-10
   [ASTEROID]
   population model = ./demo/sspp_testset_orbits.des
   spk t0 = 60188
   ndays = 395
   object1 = 1
   nobjects = 10
   spk step = 1
   nbody = T
   input format = whitespace
   [SURVEY]
   survey database = ./demo/baseline_v2.0_1yr.db
   field1 = 1
   nfields = 216011
   mpcobscode file = obslist.dat
   telescope = I11
   surveydbquery = SELECT observationId,observationStartMJD,fieldRA,fieldDEC,rotSkyPos FROM observations order by observationStartMJD

   camera = instrument_circle.dat

This generates the ephemerides for the objects we are looking for. This information will be used when running the SSPP.
Save this information as a file called 'test_oif_output.txt'.

.. warning::
   Only one instance of OIF can be run per output directory. Make sure to have different output pathways if you are running multiple instances on the same compute node. 
 
surveySimPP
-----------------------------------------

Now that we have the information about the ephemerides, we can begin to run the survey simulator to 
check if these objects are observable by the LSST.

Generate a surveySimPP Config File 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The key information about the simulation paramteres are held in the post processing configuration file.
There is a configuration file generator build into the survey simulator, which can be run using::
   
  makeConfigPP ./demo/PPConfig_test.ini --ephformat csv --trailinglosseson True
 
which will generate a default config file, named config.ini. There are several optional parameters that
can be added (see inputs). The config file will look something like this::

   # Configuration file for Solar System Post Processing package.
   
   
   [INPUTFILES]

Running surveySimPP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Finally, we have all the information required to run the survey simulator. This can be done by typing::

   surveySimPP -c ./demo/PPConfig_test.ini -l ./demo/sspp_testset_colours.txt -o ./demo/sspp_testset_orbits.des -p ./demo/test_oif_output.txt -u ./data/out/ -t testrun_e2e 
 
The first several lines of  output will look something like::
