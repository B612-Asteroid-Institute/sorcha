Welcome to Solar System Survey Simulator Post Processing's documentation!
=========================================================================
Welcome to the Solar System Survey Simulator Post Processing documentation. The survey simulator is a 
Python package for studying Solar System object population statistics. It has been designed 
with the `Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) <https://www.lsst.org>`_ in mind,
but can be adapted to be used with any survey.


This documentation webpage contains an installation guide and an overview of how the survey simulator 
works. Tutorials are provided which give examples on how to determine if an object is on a field of view, 
if it is observable with LSST, and specific guides for near earth objects, Jupiter trojans, cometary objects etc.
